A player has 60 seconds to avoid as many trucks as possible which spawn from the top of the screen at various locations and randomly move down fast or slow. Each time the player avoids the truck, they gain a point. If a player runs into the truck, their car will become broken and a short 3 second sound will play to signify that a collision has occurred. There is background music playing throughout the entire game as well. Once the 60 seconds is up, a new screen is displayed showcasing the player's score and number of times they collided with the truck.
